## Astro ChromaDB Search üöÄ

Astro ChromaDB Search is a showcase project that demonstrates the integration of ChromaDB, a vector database, with the Astro framework. The goal of this project is to create an efficient and cost-effective indexing system for embeddings, showcasing the power of combining these technologies.

### Project Overview

The project aims to perform semantic search over markdown files using the Astro framework and ChromaDB. By storing documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space, it enables semantic searches to return documents with similar meanings to the input query. This setup utilizes OpenAI embeddings and supports various embeddings from Hugging Face.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

*   Astro üöÄ
*   Tailwind üåä
*   React ‚öõÔ∏è
*   [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) for vector search
*   `pip` or Docker for [installing ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started#1-install)

### Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1.  Install dependencies: Run `yarn` to install the required dependencies.
2.  Install ChromaDB: Install ChromaDB by running `pip install chromadb` or via Docker Compose from the [official ChromaDB repository](https://github.com/arenah/chromadb).
3.  Start ChromaDB: Run `yarn start:chroma` to start ChromaDB by running `chroma run --path ./chromadb` (adjust the `./chromadb` path to your desired location).
4.  Create embeddings: Run `node src/index-builder.js` to process MDX files in the `content` folder and create the necessary embeddings.
5.  Perform searches: Use the UI or the `/api/search?query={phrase}` endpoint to perform searches based on the provided query.
